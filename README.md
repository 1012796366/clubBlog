This is my personal blog. It's created by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I designed this theme with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

Thanks for these authors for some codes:

* [Gao Haoyang](https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io)
* [Liberize](https://github.com/liberize/liberize.github.com)
* [Oleh](http://o.zasadnyy.com/blog/optimized-jekyll-site-with-grunt/)

The site is deployed via [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) now, switch to `dev` branch to checkout the source code.
